# Conics Lattice App

This web application generates formulas for all conics that intersect the fractional integer lattice. It utilizes D3.js and Chart.js to display a grid lattice that indicates the fractions and labels the points on the parabola with fractions. The application aims to hit as many fractional integers as possible with various conic equations, including examples like y=(x^2)/64 and y=(x^2)/60.

2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open `src/index.html` in a web browser to view the application.

## Usage

- The application will display a grid lattice with fractional integers.
- Conic equations will be generated and displayed on the grid.
- Points on the parabola will be labeled with their corresponding fractional values.

## Dependencies

- D3.js: A JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualizations.
- Chart.js: A JavaScript library for creating charts and graphs.
